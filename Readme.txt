Exe-Bundle v1.0

If you get this file from PSC(PlanetSourceCode.com), you can use the code as you like, but give me credit where it is due.

Coded in VB6.0. Very simple code. I agree not much commented.

What I didnt do out of laziness:
- Add Stub(ExeBundleStub.exe) as resource in ExeBundle.vbp.
- Ability to change icons.

If you add/modify this project, please send me one copy. It will be greatly appreciated.

Compile both projects. Then copy ExeBundleStub.exe in same folder as ExeBundle.exe(GUI).
